# pablrdle
 
 This is a clone of the popular daily word game Wordle (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).  
 
 I have adapted the original which was only for 5 letter words and made this 8 letter word verison.  
 
 Why 8 letters?  Other than it's MUCH harder, it pays homage to 8 letter words in Scrabble that are created when you use all 7 of your tiles (called Bingo).  
 
 Yes...I should have called this game BINGO or BINGORDLE.  So maybe I'll change the name eventually.  But for now it's a play on my name (Pablo) and Wordle to make a new 8 letter word!  :)
